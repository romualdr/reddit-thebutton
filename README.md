# reddit-thebutton

/r/thebutton is a social experiment on reddit. It was at first a April Fools' joke, but became very popular among redditors.

This is a opensource Chrome extention to watch it.

## How it works

It features a clean yet very easy interface.

It only calls reddit once, to get a socket url, to connect to the button tick and get the time.
